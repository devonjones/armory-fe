**Getting Started**

1. Make sure node is installed
2. After checkout out the repo, run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp` to compile the React templates and build the JS blob in /src

4. Run a webserver at the root of the repo `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
5. Point your web browser at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
